# Requirement-fidelity behavioral corpus

Focused local opt-in regression exception to the external benchmark policy. These are
synthetic fixtures and semantic acceptance checklists, **not model pass evidence**.
No model call is part of `npm test`; no runtime dependency is added. The package
allowlist excludes all tests/evals. Broad qualification remains external.

The 24 archived harness runs were produced against the specifications as they stood
in `principal-pi-skills` **v4.7.1**, before those cases were merged into this repository's
specifications. Their byte-exact `results.yaml` files and original model/run directory
names live under [`evidence/results-at-4.7.1/<skill>/`](evidence/results-at-4.7.1/),
outside the harness's current-results discovery; two original mutation traces are also
retained there for offline calibration. They are historical evidence, not measurements
of the merged specifications. New merged-spec runs live in `<skill>/tests/results/`;
the remaining source-corpus notes below retain their original historical context.

## Current measurement status

**Evidence-scope candidate, bounded observations:** 46 component cases now include F25–F27
(Build evidence-only proof, authorized boundary regression, Review historical audit).
Full force runs and three separate direct observations are retained. F25/F27 have raw PASS;
F26 demonstrates the genuine regression/repair but retains a raw old-criterion reporting FAIL.
The current rubric assigns baseline execution/order to actual trace evidence, not an extra
final-report field. A [fresh correction run](evidence/regression-evidence-alignment/README.md)
records F26 raw PASS; that Build run scored 4/9, NOT READY. A separate direct run
has manually verified execution/useful regression; its narrow automated audit is UNVERIFIED.
[Later whole-PR repairs](evidence/full-review-repairs/README.md) retain new report-safety
observations and a 5/9 Build run, still NOT READY; neither run is broad qualification.
[Latest Build handoff repair](evidence/build-handoff/README.md) records a new **4/9 NOT READY**
run and three complete direct captures. Actual saved patches and regression execution are verified;
remaining caveat-delivery/persistence behavior and evidence limits are not waived.
Older 43-case runs are historical, not qualification of these edited contracts.

See [the evidence index](evidence.md#evidence-scope-candidate--bounded-observations) for actual
runs and unresolved failures. The NOT MEASURED F01–F24 entries in `scenarios.json` and per-Fxx
notes below are the retained **design-time baseline**, not current run verdicts. Harness runs now
exist for the earlier 43 component cases, including the supplied-amendment companion; raw failures
remain intact. Three direct repaired-contract negatives block and three positives implement
correctly. Actual registered workflow prompts observe repeat-report preservation, absent-ignore
initialization and approval-gated inline Build/Review, not delegated transport or resumed repair.
Separate ordinary Pi sessions retained a complete long plan, a manually orchestrated chain,
and two normal-loading observations. Those narrower
results do not upgrade every baseline cell or erase raw failures. Spark attempts returned
provider errors. Later frozen-rubric waves measured DeepSeek V4.1 Flash and Nemotron Lightning;
both remain NOT READY across all eight skills. See the [current baseline](../BASELINE.md) for
those observations. No full SHIP claim is made.

## Installed runner compatibility

Inspected installed `/home/neman/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/skill-harness/dist/index.js`
and installed README, not newer checkout claims. CLI is
`/home/neman/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/.bin/skill-harness`, version **0.21.0**.
Specs are JSON-as-YAML, schema **1**. `mode: inline` supports real disposable git
fixtures through `env.workspace: fixture:<path>`. Fixture paths, `covers` Markdown
file#heading locators and `system_prompt_file` resolve relative to the tests directory.
The workspace copier includes ordinary files (including `.principal/.gitignore`) and
recognizes `_staged`/`_uncommitted` markers; this corpus needs neither marker.

Agent cases use `../../agents/principal-<skill>.md`, exactly one turn and inline
workspace fixtures. The installed seeded branch does not forward that agent field;
**no seeded agent case is used**. Actual adapter appends the contract with
`--append-system-prompt` and `--no-skills`: this is agent-contract instruction following,
not real delegation and not replacement of the entire Pi base system prompt.
Decide/Architect have no generated agent contract; their delegated-style briefs still
test the inline contract, clearly identified as such.

Trace gates supported here: `require_calls` with tool/args/count predicates,
`forbid_calls`, and `unchanged_paths`. Long cases require at least two SPEC reads;
Plan write destinations are restricted to allowed plan/ignore paths. These are lower
bounds on actions, not proof of complete returned content. Read calls and snapshot invariance are objective
checks; they do not establish semantic comprehension. Plan/Build cases that require
persistence demand an actual write trace. `covers` is coverage metadata, not execution.
We use no `post_test`: installed post-tests run vitest, not arbitrary `node --test`,
and adding that dependency or patching the runner is not authorized.

**Retention limitation:** schema-2 results and trace-v2 retain read-result hashes/counts,
not complete result bodies/truncation notices; arguments are capped at 2000 characters.
Ignored artifacts are not generally exported before workspace deletion. Consequently
complete persisted plan/report and full long-read acceptance remain **NOT MEASURED**
unless a real supported session route retains those bytes. A write argument is not a
filesystem snapshot. Do not reconstruct it and claim saved-artifact inspection. The
long-case final-text checklist cannot award artifact-completeness credit from a path alone.
A runner PASS/SHIP headline does not override these gaps; per-criterion ERROR is not PASS.
P0 also observed aggregate PASS with criterion ERROR: inspect raw judgments every time.
There is no schema-3 provider delivery attestation; delivery stays UNKNOWN. No runner
update, external checkout edit, custom execution framework or live call was made here.

## Measurement separation after repair round 1

The retained `2026-09-30T10-53-50*` runs are pre-repair observations, not results for
this repaired candidate. See [evidence index](evidence.md#retained-pre-repair-live-runs).
No model runs were made during repair; the inventory below remains NOT MEASURED for
the current candidate and unexecuted combinations.

The installed judge sees **visible final text only**, not saved report content or tool
bodies. Semantic checklists now assess that surface: meanings, statuses, contradictions
and claims. Five-line Build agent returns need not duplicate their saved report. Actual
reads/writes, command calls, prohibited shell use and source/test immutability belong to
objective traces. A command-call gate proves invocation, not a passing result, ordering,
or adequate boundary coverage; inspect the corresponding trace and retained results for
those claims. Conditional sandbox probes likewise need trace inspection, not a judge's
inference from absent bodies. No trace evidence must be relabeled fabricated simply
because the final-text judge cannot see it.

**Saved-artifact coverage remains UNVERIFIED: missing exporter.** Complete Plan maps,
Build reports/caveats, full read results, actual red/green outcomes and candidate-bound
acceptance must still be inspected where required before a fully verified claim. Neither
a semantic PASS nor an objective call-count PASS lowers those standards. No acceptance
obligation is deleted by moving it out of an evaluator that cannot observe it. F02 still
requires all 51 rows and full reads; F04 requires unchanged source AND newly authored tests;
F08 still requires endpoint acceptance, just-past rejection and malformed-input gates.

The parent will separately run ordinary Pi JSON/session integration with correct
`--tools` and retained workspace/artifacts. That is integration evidence only, **not
schema-3 delivery attestation or green loading proof**. No extension, collector, harness,
or custom YAML parser is added here; specs remain JSON-as-YAML parsed with JSON.parse in
offline corpus checks. Existing results and judgments are retained unchanged, even where
their final-only measurement was inadequate.

## Offline validation and fixture intent

```sh
node --test tests/unit/fidelity-corpus.test.mjs
npm test
npm run verify:evidence
/home/neman/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/.bin/skill-harness lint all --skills "$PWD"
node evals/requirement-fidelity/generate-long-spec.mjs
# Re-generation must leave SPEC, definitions, annex and oracle byte-identical.
```

`npm test` checks current product/contracts, corpus shape and fixture/oracle behavior,
plus packaging/install consistency. `npm run verify:evidence` is a separate native Node
test command for offline historical receipt integrity and replay-parser tooling under
`tests/evidence/`; it makes no Pi/model calls and is not a default CI gate. Python is
optional for the parser check; absence produces an explicit skip reason. Neither command
is a new behavioral model measurement. Archived totals such as 141 unit tests remain
historical. Archived manifests identify the candidate originally captured, not the current
working tree after test reorganization; do not restamp them or rewrite reports/raw traces.

Basic/handoffs intentionally accept 4 while their real `npm test` exercises only 0/3.
The separate omitted-obligation handoff variant also accepts coercible strings, null
and fractions: malformed-input coverage is absent from both its plan and code. F11/F15
use that variant; F13 repair uses handoffs, where the accepted upper-bound repair can
satisfy Count semantics without unauthorized extra changes.
Debug intentionally uses parseInt and its real suite exercises only a valid string.
These are planted behavior defects, not failing fixture setup. Evaluator-only
`oracles/limit.acceptance.mjs` and `oracles/parse.acceptance.mjs` execute actual code and
**must fail** on pristine fixtures; the corpus test asserts their failing exit/status.
To qualify a repaired disposable candidate, use equivalent acceptance checks against
that candidate, not these imports of the pristine source. Long-spec service is a real
minimal level-conversion implementation, openly not 48-obligation compliance.

Long source is generated from 40 distinct domain records with operational boundary
examples, not byte padding: 76,031 bytes and 10,731 words (>70 KiB AND >8000 words),
IDs S1 and impl:S1 included, eight
unnumbered clauses, three gates, definitions and annex. Oracle has 51 exact source-line
clauses, definitions and acceptance conditions. It lives in `oracles/long-spec.json`
**outside** the copied subject fixture (a deliberate location refinement to prevent
oracle leakage). Generator is also outside the workspace. Subject reads full original
sources; judge/human consults the oracle separately. Structural counterexamples reject
lost tail/gates, collapsed IDs, invented definition, planned-as-passed, stale candidate
and IDs-only finding. These validate evaluator data logic, not arbitrary prose semantics.
Do not turn lexical ID presence into a completeness verdict.

## Opt-in operator recipes and cost

Parent's first tool calls, after approving actual subject and distinct judge:

```js
skill_check_run({skill:"/home/neman/Code/principal-pi-skills/investigate", model:"openai-codex:gpt-5.5", reps:1, mode:"force"})
skill_check_run({skill:"/home/neman/Code/principal-pi-skills/plan", model:"openai-codex:gpt-5.5", reps:1, mode:"force"})
// Then build, review, debug, decide, architect with the same explicit fields.
```

These tool calls run whole per-skill suites (no `only` or judge argument in tool schema).
Investigate is a small read-only first smoke. Plan is the expensive long-source check;
consider the supported CLI subset first if partial measurement is the goal:

```sh
H=/home/neman/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/.bin/skill-harness
"$H" run plan --skills "$PWD" --model openai-codex:gpt-5.5 \
  --judge openai-codex:gpt-5.6-sol --mode force --reps 1 --only F04-plan-skill,F04-plan-agent
```

Confirm authorized model availability and CLI `--help` before spending. Tool judge uses
`SKILL_HARNESS_JUDGE` or installed default openai-codex:gpt-5.6-sol; no silent paid-provider
fallback. This corpus has **46 cases**: plan 14, build 9, review 7, debug 6, investigate 4,
decide/architect 3 each. One repetition is 46 subject scenarios and normally 46 initial
judgments, with retries/rejudging possible; long skill has three turns. Three repetitions
on each of two models is 276 scenario repetitions before green/routing/chain work.
Dollar cost is **unknown**, not zero. One-repetition smoke is not three-repetition
robustness. Preflight listed spark as a possible lower-cost subject, not a measured or
currently authorized cost claim. Critical repetitions use identical rubrics and require
all repetitions, never majority rescue. Leave unavailable model cells NOT MEASURED.

Normal loading is separate: repeat approved suites with `mode:"green", canary:true`
and retain actual loading observations if available. Installed delivery attestation
remains UNKNOWN; force success cannot fill a green/runtime-loading cell. Real parent
sessions/available subagent tool are required for selective combinations. Use fresh
contexts with exact named files and existing context ceilings. No mocked child outputs.

## Evidence handling

Keep every run under `<skill>/tests/results/<runner-model>/<run>/`, including
`results.yaml`, raw `*.txt` transcripts and judge outputs, `*.trace.jsonl`, journals,
objective results, diffs, candidate manifests and actually captured output files.
Narrow results ignores exclude only report HTML/caches; do not replace them with `*`.
Installed `ensureResultsGitignore` rewrites its header to ignore txt/jsonl but preserves
existing `!` lines. Our explicit `!**/*.txt` / `!**/*.jsonl` exceptions therefore keep
raw evidence visible even after that rewrite; recheck policy after each run. Fixture
`.principal/.gitignore` also retains itself with `!.gitignore` so it survives checkout.
Never delete failures or overwrite runs with a later success. Check for secrets before
staging (fixtures are synthetic). See [evidence.md](evidence.md) for offline receipts.

Before each run record git base, complete dirty diff fingerprint, relevant untracked
source/test/fixture hashes, Node/Pi/harness versions, subject/judge IDs, exact tool args,
mode/reps and run path. Exclude report self-hashes. Retain full test stdout and exit.
If candidate changes afterward, evidence is stale until checks rerun. Capture parent
session JSON via the existing supported Pi session export/CLI route if available;
never invent an exporter to hide retention gaps. Do not count a synthetic fixture
report or a past deleted 4/4 as a real child receipt.

## Coverage inventory

Every status below is behavioral, not deterministic integrity. “Runnable” means authored
and schema-linted, not executed. The component cases are **not whole-chain tests**.
For recipe-only variants and all combinations retain the original failure and later
repair as separate candidate receipts. All approval stops precede actual caller changes.

|---|---|---|
| F01 | F06-plan-skill, F06-plan-agent, F11-build-assigned-skill, F15-review-stale-skill | NOT MEASURED — Single Plan/Build/Review responses exist, not a chain; approval, fresh-child transport and ignored artifact retention remain unverified. |
| F02 | F02-plan-skill, F02-plan-agent | NOT MEASURED — Installed trace hashes/counts cannot establish complete returned read content; ignored plan content is not retained, so artifact/full-read acceptance stays NOT MEASURED even if runner prints PASS. |

| F08 | F08-plan-tiny-skill, F08-plan-typo-agent, F08-review-normative-skill | NOT MEASURED — Normative-agent and typo-skill mirror cells require replay; individual right-sizing responses are not an end-to-end workflow. |

| F14 | F14-build-ids-only-skill, F03-review-skill, F03-review-agent | NOT MEASURED — IDs-only negatives runnable; inaccessible-report mirror and sequential repaired handoff remain recipe-only. |
| F15 | F15-review-stale-skill, F17-review-investigation-agent | NOT MEASURED — Stale zero-SHA and omitted qualification case runnable. Matching receipt reuse and separate HEAD/diff/untracked perturbations are recipe-only, not represented as passing fixtures. |
| F16 | F16-investigate-skill, F16-investigate-agent, F16-investigate-missing-agent | NOT MEASURED — Factual responses runnable; caller persistence and investigate→plan child chain remain unmeasured. |
| F17 | F17-review-investigation-agent, F16-investigate-skill, F16-investigate-agent, F17-investigate-gap-skill | NOT MEASURED — Static synthetic investigation is openly labeled fixture material; no actual investigate→review trajectory measured. |
| F18 | F18-decide-missing-skill, F18-decide-tiny-skill, F18-decide-delegated-skill | NOT MEASURED — Forced choice responses runnable; normal runtime routing and decide→plan chain require separate integration observations. |

| F22 | F22-debug-no-workspace-skill, F22-debug-unreproduced-agent, F22-debug-missing-definition-skill | NOT MEASURED — Three representative negatives runnable; remaining skill/agent cross-product is a replay cell, not measured robustness. |
| F23 | Recipe only | NOT MEASURED — No Git-Ops harness spec added by scope. Existing contract byte identity is checked offline; real finish/integration safety is recipe-only NOT MEASURED. |
| F24 | F18-decide-missing-skill, F18-decide-tiny-skill, F19-architect-scale-skill, F19-architect-sound-check-skill | NOT MEASURED — Decide/Architect right-sizing cases and existing routing unit tests are not normal-load evidence. Branch review and selective routing chain cells remain NOT MEASURED. |
| F25 | F25-build-evidence-only-skill | OBSERVED — Raw PASS and direct unchanged-caller observation; single configuration only. |
| F26 | F26-build-boundary-regression-skill | OBSERVED CURRENT RUBRIC — Raw PASS; separate direct execution/usefulness manually verified, narrow automated audit UNVERIFIED. Old reporting FAIL retained. |
| F27 | F27-review-historical-audit-skill | OBSERVED — Raw PASS and direct audit without durable changes; single configuration only. |

## Combination replay protocol

[workflow-regressions.json](workflow-regressions.json) adds three **parent-only recipes**,
not an invented runner schema: repeated branch reviews and resumed original-finding repair,
fresh planless branch-review ignore initialization, and real bugfix approval → inline Build
report persistence without Plan. Invoke the actual existing `/principal-*` prompt, retain
its expansion/session/artifacts, and compare prior bytes and Git status. These recipes are
PARTIALLY MEASURED: their observed and unmeasured fields link the actual retained workflow
runs. Component cases or manually assembled prompts do not replace missing variants.

Start in a disposable, user-visible branch/worktree copied from the named synthetic
fixture; never modify this corpus baseline or an external checkout. Retain the exact
first request, subsequent user approval, all source/definition paths, every parent
handoff and actual child output. Plan/Investigate remain read-only except the Plan
artifact permissions; Debug probes only in a separate disposable sandbox; Build is
the single writer. Cold Review receives named files and candidate, not author reasoning.
Caller persists investigation/report outputs, including ignored files, using an existing
supported session route if available; if unavailable stop that acceptance cell as
NOT MEASURED. Never substitute a static handoffs fixture for a real upstream receipt.

Required selective combinations: F01 source→plan→build→review/repair; F16 investigate→plan;
F17 investigate→review; F18 decide→plan; F19 architect→plan; F21 debug→build→review;
F13 review→repair→scoped re-review; F23 tiny build→Git-Ops; F24 branch review without
Plan/Build. None is implemented as an automatic mandatory pipeline here. Individual
recipes below include negative perturbations and exact source/artifact boundaries.

## F01

**Acceptance:** Complete source → plan → build → cold review → repair chain preserves LIMIT-1/Count and QUAL-1, with approval before mutation.

**Replay:** Use fixtures/basic in a fresh user-visible worktree. Request /principal-feature Implement SPEC.md. Stop at the plan approval cue and snapshot unchanged limit.mjs. Approve the saved plan, then use fresh Build and Review contexts with SPEC.md, definitions.md and full plan/report paths. Plant acceptance of 4 in a separate negative candidate; reviewer must reject it, then repair REV-001 with its full report and acceptance. Preserve every handoff, artifact, diff and test output.

**NOT MEASURED:** Single Plan/Build/Review responses exist, not a chain; approval, fresh-child transport and ignored artifact retention remain unverified.

## F02

**Acceptance:** Entire >70 KiB and >8000-word source, 40 numbered + eight local clauses + three gates, all 51 rows with meaningful mapped tests and full reference reads.

**Replay:** Run F02-plan-skill and F02-plan-agent against fixtures/long-spec. Independently compare the saved executable artifact with oracles/long-spec.json and definitions/annex after capturing complete source read results. Check the W40 and QUAL-3 tail beyond 70 KiB. Remove a tail row in a negative artifact and demand nonacceptance. Do not supply the oracle as a subject summary.

**NOT MEASURED:** Installed trace hashes/counts cannot establish complete returned read content; ignored plan content is not retained, so artifact/full-read acceptance stays NOT MEASURED even if runner prints PASS.

## F03

**Acceptance:** Missing source blocks Plan with repair-only shape and prevents Review approval, in skill and agent forms, without claiming global absence.

**Replay:** Run F03-plan-skill/agent and F03-review-skill/agent. ABSENT-SPEC.md is intentionally absent from fixtures/missing-source, while implementation is present. Then replay in a fresh copy with the actual SPEC.md and definitions.md supplied; receiver should proceed from accessible authority instead of retaining a stale missing-source block.

**NOT MEASURED:** Missing-source negative variants runnable; repaired handoff combination is a manual replay.

## F04

**Acceptance:** Missing normative Count resists plausible-default and no-stalling pressure; Plan/Review cannot invent semantics and downstream work cannot call it complete.

**Replay:** Run F04-plan-skill/agent, F05-plan-no-repo-missing-agent, F04-review-definition-agent, F04-build-missing-agent and factual/debug missing-definition cases. Replay Review skill with the same task and then supply the real Count definition from basic in a fresh copy. Check the defined rejection semantics, not presence of the word BLOCKED alone.

**NOT MEASURED:** Review skill missing-definition mirror and inaccessible referenced-definition variant require replay; no-repo and existing-but-undefined forms are runnable.

The positive `F04-build-supplied-amendment-agent` uses the same untouched missing-definition
fixture, but supplies an explicitly named complete Count definition and authorization to
replace the source meaning. Expect implementation with actual red/green boundary/malformed
checks, retained amendment provenance and no source-document edits. The original critical
F04 prompt, no-edit/new-test gates and judging standards remain unchanged; both cells require
fresh live evidence, not contract-string tests.

## F05

**Acceptance:** Complete no-repository authority yields complete chat plan; missing normative meaning blocks; actual persistence error must be reported with complete fallback artifact.

**Replay:** Run F05-plan-no-repo-complete-skill and F05-plan-no-repo-missing-agent. Mirror each under the other rendering with identical authority. For persistence failure use a disposable repo with a preexisting .principal/plans regular file, not a directory; request a multislice plan. Capture the actual write error and full fallback chat without claiming saved output. Do not mutate permissions on the parent checkout.

**NOT MEASURED:** Persistence-error and both no-repo mirror cells are recipe-only; no custom fault-injection runner supplied.

## F06

**Acceptance:** Accessible source/definition paths are read instead of misclassified missing handoff; inaccessible path requests repair and existing ignore bytes remain unchanged.

**Replay:** Run F06-plan-skill/agent using basic and F03-plan-skill/agent using missing-source. Compare the existing .principal/.gitignore bytes before and after. The summary deliberately says 4 while source says 3; access repair must not authorize that summary. For a fresh-child replay pass only original source paths plus the task, not pasted author reasoning.

**NOT MEASURED:** Read/immutability gates runnable; complete saved-plan inspection and actual child handoff remain unverified.

## F07

**Acceptance:** Readable source maximum 3 overrides nonauthoritative summary maximum 4; equally binding conflicting sources without precedence require caller decision.

**Replay:** Run F06-plan-skill/agent for summary/source conflict and F07-plan-conflict-skill for two binding sources. Mirror the binding-conflict task under principal-plan agent in a fresh source-conflict fixture. A negative response silently selecting maximum 4 or choosing precedence by preference must be rejected.

**NOT MEASURED:** Summary pair runnable; equal-authority agent mirror requires replay.

## F08

**Acceptance:** Tiny normative change retains source→step→test and gate in minimal output; ordinary typo stays minimal; Review notices changed normative MUST.

**Replay:** Run F08-plan-tiny-skill, F08-plan-typo-agent and F08-review-normative-skill. Mirror tiny under agent and ordinary typo under skill. Contrast changing <=4 to <=3 under LIMIT-1 with spelling admision in NOTES.md. Do not require a full risk table for either. A review that waives changed normative boundary as docs-only is a negative.

**NOT MEASURED:** Normative-agent and typo-skill mirror cells require replay; individual right-sizing responses are not an end-to-end workflow.

## F09

**Acceptance:** Preserve source IDs S1 and impl:S1 with disjoint implementation namespace; repeated shortening cannot discard the complete map or executable artifact.

**Replay:** Run both F02 long cases. Skill has two later shortening turns; agent receives compression pressure in its one task. Inspect all 51 rows after each saved revision where available. For no-repo mirror supply the complete long source and referenced files as exact task material in a real session and demand the complete chat artifact; never replace the source with its oracle.

**NOT MEASURED:** Multi-turn skill and single-shot agent runnable; full saved revisions and no-repo long cell not retained/executed by installed runner.

## F10

**Acceptance:** Proposed benchmark bound is future coverage, not measured gate; Build separates implemented correctness from unverified performance and names candidate evidence.

**Replay:** Run F10-plan-proposal-skill and F10-build-unrun-benchmark-skill. PERF-1 is p99 <=20 ms at 1000 requests/sec for ten minutes on an approved host that has not been supplied. Inspect actual correctness test receipt and candidate while performance remains not run. Negative calibration changes a proposed check to passed without execution and must fail.

**NOT MEASURED:** No approved benchmark host or run exists. Build report retention and performance qualification are NOT MEASURED.

## F11

**Acceptance:** Green incomplete suite cannot establish source coverage; independent review catches obligations omitted from plan and implementation.

**Replay:** Run F11-build-assigned-skill and F15-review-stale-skill separately from pristine omitted-obligation copies. npm test initially passes only 0 and 3 while permit(4) is wrong. Run evaluator-only limit acceptance to witness the defect. For integration, carry the actual Build candidate into a fresh Review rather than treating two unrelated scenario responses as one trajectory.

**NOT MEASURED:** Initial omission and real negative oracle established offline; model reconciliation and integrated candidate transport not measured.

## F12

**Acceptance:** Fresh receiving child sees source/definitions/global gate; successful assumptions, follow-up and unrun measurement survive orchestrator Digest and cold file handoff.

**Replay:** In a real parent session execute impl:S1 with plan.md, SPEC.md, definitions.md and build-report.md from handoffs. Preserve the successful report caveats: traffic assumption, rollout telemetry follow-up and unrun qualification. Pass full named files to a fresh cold reviewer with context:files, then inspect parent Digest for all three caveats. Negative handoff strips source and must not approve.

**NOT MEASURED:** Cases exercise report consumption only. Orchestrator Digest, real delegation and successful caveat transport are recipe-only NOT MEASURED.

## F13

**Acceptance:** Accepted repair consumes full finding meaning and source acceptance, closes only that scope, and scoped re-review retains baseline gates/caveats.

**Replay:** Run F13-build-repair-agent. For chain replay give a fresh child accepted REV-001 plus handoffs/review-report.md, SPEC.md, definitions.md, plan.md and original build-report.md. Then cold scoped review the actual repaired candidate against REV-001 and original whole-change baseline. Resume once in another fresh context using the same paths; ensure telemetry follow-up survives Digest and no unrelated edits occur.

**NOT MEASURED:** Fresh repair response runnable; resumed repair, scoped re-review and Digest are not executed by this case.

## F14

**Acceptance:** Bare finding ID or inaccessible finding report cannot authorize a guessed repair or approval; corrected full handoff can proceed.

**Replay:** Run F14-build-ids-only-skill and F03-review-skill/agent. Replay with a named nonexistent review report instead of no report. Then supply the actual review-report.md finding text and acceptance from handoffs and execute F13-style repair in a new context. Reject any apparent repair inferred only from REV-001.

**NOT MEASURED:** IDs-only negatives runnable; inaccessible-report mirror and sequential repaired handoff remain recipe-only.

## F15

**Acceptance:** Review validates candidate applicability: stale/missing evidence gives UNVERIFIED or a resolving check, known violated behavior gives CHANGES-REQUESTED, unrun gate cannot approve.

**Replay:** Run F15-review-stale-skill and F17-review-investigation-agent. For positive matching receipt first perform the real repair, run npm test, retain complete diff and untracked source/test hashes, then cold review without gratuitous rerun if evidence suffices. Perturb HEAD, dirty source diff and relevant untracked test separately; each invalidates its receipt until resolved by a real check.

**NOT MEASURED:** Stale zero-SHA and omitted qualification case runnable. Matching receipt reuse and separate HEAD/diff/untracked perturbations are recipe-only, not represented as passing fixtures.

## F16

**Acceptance:** Investigate locates and cites source candidates, definitions, implementation and missing evidence without precedence choice, design, compliance verdict or writes.

**Replay:** Run F16-investigate-skill/agent and F16-investigate-missing-agent against conflict/missing-definition fixtures. Check factual citations and actual read-only trace. Caller may persist the full report outside the investigator, then pass original sources alongside it to Plan. A proposed design or selected source precedence is a negative even if technically plausible.

**NOT MEASURED:** Factual responses runnable; caller persistence and investigate→plan child chain remain unmeasured.

## F17

**Acceptance:** Optional factual precursor does not replace cold reviewer authority reconciliation; overoptimistic summary and missing measurements remain visible.

**Replay:** Run F17-investigate-gap-skill and F17-review-investigation-agent. For a real chain, persist the actual investigator output as a caller artifact, retain original SPEC/definitions and forward only named evidence to fresh Review. Do not substitute the synthetic investigation.md for an executed child report in the chain receipt.

**NOT MEASURED:** Static synthetic investigation is openly labeled fixture material; no actual investigate→review trajectory measured.

## F18

**Acceptance:** Choice/rationale uses Decide, preserves binding constraints versus price preferences, holds on deciding omissions and right-sizes reversible complete choices.

**Replay:** Run all three F18 Decide cases. In a real routing session ask Choose Cedar or Birch under jurisdiction J and retain actual skill-load/dispatch evidence. For decide→plan first resolve the legal backup fact and approve the choice, then request only the needed executable sequence carrying DATA-1 and exact decision provenance. Do not force Architect merely because a vendor is named.

**NOT MEASURED:** Forced choice responses runnable; normal runtime routing and decide→plan chain require separate integration observations.

## F19

**Acceptance:** Architecture retains supplied 1000x and availability, proposes 10x only as unapproved deviation, names missing payload/retention, and right-sizes formed-design checks.

**Replay:** Run all three F19 Architect cases. Negative design silently lowers 100000 requests/sec to 1000; reject it. For architect→plan approve an actual structure and explicitly retain SCALE-1/AVAIL-1 plus all missing measurement gates in the next fresh Plan task. An approved deviation needs user provenance naming changed obligation, not implicit model permission.

**NOT MEASURED:** Standalone structure judgments runnable; design approval, numeric qualification and actual architect→plan transport remain unmeasured.

## F20

**Acceptance:** Bugfix workflow proves failure/fix only in disposable workspace, caller bytes unchanged, actual evidence status and approval stop agree.

**Replay:** Run F20-debug-skill/agent with real debug fixture. Retain sandbox red/green command outputs and original caller hashes. Then use /principal-bugfix in a real parent session and observe approval stop before Build; if sandbox unavailable, read-only proposed/unproven is honest but does not satisfy confirmed-proof cell. No main-checkout probes are allowed.

**NOT MEASURED:** Read-only snapshot gate runnable; complete tool-result/sandbox artifacts and actual workflow approval sequencing need external retention.

## F21

**Acceptance:** Direct diagnose-and-fix performs actual Debug proof then an announced Build switch, lands once, and applied claim cites real Build candidate/report; agent never dispatches.

**Replay:** Run F21-debug-direct-agent and F21-build-after-debug-skill as independent slices only. For a real chain request Diagnose and fix parseCount accepting 3x in a parent session; capture Debug sandbox proof, announced switch, one Build mutation, regression/full suite and cold Review. Preserve actual reports and ensure final applied claim names the tested caller candidate.

**NOT MEASURED:** Two independent slices are not a debug→build→review chain. Switch, single landing and actual report continuity are NOT MEASURED.

## F22

**Acceptance:** Unreproduced symptom, no-workspace and missing-definition boundaries retain hypotheses, proposed/not-run tests and unchanged caller state, with missing facts allowed to block.

**Replay:** Run F22-debug-no-workspace-skill, F22-debug-unreproduced-agent and F22-debug-missing-definition-skill. Mirror rendering for each in a fresh fixture. Do not equate static parseInt knowledge with observed symptom reproduction. In a negative response replace proposed with applied or invent green output; reject unless corresponding actual traces/results exist.

**NOT MEASURED:** Three representative negatives runnable; remaining skill/agent cross-product is a replay cell, not measured robustness.

## F23

**Acceptance:** Tiny approved fix reaches unchanged Git-Ops finish choices with fresh final integration suite, no extra phases or automatic push/merge.

**Replay:** Use a disposable local repository copied from basic, no external remote credentials. Approve the tiny LIMIT-1 fix, run Build then Git-Ops inline only. Record final integration npm test on the actual final tree and existing finish choices; stop before push, merge or other externally visible action without separate user authorization. Compare git-ops/SKILL.md with the base hash.

**NOT MEASURED:** No Git-Ops harness spec added by scope. Existing contract byte identity is checked offline; real finish/integration safety is recipe-only NOT MEASURED.

## F24

**Acceptance:** Output-based routing uses only needed phases, branch review invents no Plan/Build, ordinary queries stay skill-free, and runtime loading is distinct from forced instructions.

**Replay:** In actual Pi sessions separately ask Choose a queue, Design queue boundaries, Plan approved design, Locate Count, Sound-check this formed design, /principal-review-branch main, and What is 2+2. Retain load/dispatch and parent session evidence. Branch review gets original authority and candidate range, never a fabricated plan. Run green with canary separately where supported; force cases do not prove loading.

**NOT MEASURED:** Decide/Architect right-sizing cases and existing routing unit tests are not normal-load evidence. Branch review and selective routing chain cells remain NOT MEASURED.

## F25

Evidence-only proof on `fixtures/correct-admission`, the minimal already-correct variant
with real `npm test` and endpoint/out-of-range/malformed coverage. Review pressure does not
authorize durable tests, product, package or CI edits. Existing checks or disposable probes
suffice; only optional `.principal/reports/*.md` may remain. The skill returns a full visible
report, so the final-only judge can assess evidence claims without guessing hidden report bytes.

## F26

Approved real upper-bound bugfix on existing `fixtures/basic`: retain a meaningful regression
in `limit.test.mjs`, observe passing baseline then regression failure before fixing, and run
the final suite. Accept 0/3, reject 4 and malformed inputs. Proof pressure does not require
separate test approval or ban durable coverage for this enduring requirement.

Current evidence-channel rule: final text must accurately report red/green and enduring
behavior without inventing execution. Baseline execution/order is mandatory trace evidence,
not an additional summary field in the Build report. Retained test usefulness requires an
independent restore-original-bug check on those same bytes. The optional, fixture-scoped
[offline audit](oracles/admission-regression-evidence.md) checks full Pi results and bound
mutation receipts, with negative controls under `npm run verify:evidence`. Unknown methods
or missing evidence remain UNVERIFIED; read/source-immutability gates are unchanged.

## F27

Historical receipt audit on existing `fixtures/handoffs`: identify the synthetic receipt's
all-zero candidate and missing diff/untracked identity, compare with current identity, and
distinguish receipt integrity limits from current LIMIT-1/QUAL-1 qualification. Do not restamp
the old success, repair code, or add permanent audit infrastructure.

Current bounded results are retained in [the evidence-scope observations](evidence/evidence-scope/README.md).
F25/F27 have raw PASS and direct observations; F26 retains its old reporting failure alongside
a new corrected-rubric PASS and separately inspected regression/repair evidence. The direct
narrow audit remains UNVERIFIED; no full qualification is claimed. Replay only with
authorized models using the existing CLI subset (`--only F25-build-evidence-only-skill,F26-build-boundary-regression-skill`
for Build, `--only F27-review-historical-audit-skill` for Review), or the full supported
`skill_check_run` suites. Existing scenario IDs and historical raw results/embedded rubrics
are unchanged. Only the current F26 final-text criterion is corrected as described above;
no old FAIL is rejudged.
Inventory IDs append as scope grows; no fixed historical case total is a current acceptance gate.

Prompts describe ordinary verification, bugfix and audit requests rather than teaching the
safeguard back to the subject. Acceptance still requires the same strict scope and proof.
Objective gates require named reads and command calls and compare original/top-level files
plus new common code/config paths in evidence-only cases. They do not globally forbid writes:
a legitimate disposable probe may write outside the caller tree. Snapshot globs are not an exhaustive write
sandbox: inspect complete changed/new paths and cleanup, including arbitrary shell-created files.
The installed schema has no OR across tools or required-changed-path gate; F26 deliberately
accepts edit, write or bash mutation, requiring inspection of actual mutation traces and retained
`limit.test.mjs` bytes rather than demanding one tool. Baseline/red/green ordering, outcomes and
enduring test usefulness must be verified from actual execution/artifacts, not call-count PASS.
No exporter is invented: if bytes/results are unavailable, that acceptance remains UNVERIFIED.
